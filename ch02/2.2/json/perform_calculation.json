#a Assuming each user has their own PC, we can use hostname to uniquely identify the subject
#b We use the third-person present tense for our verbs for simplicity
#c We are futureproofing our event for supporting other calculations (multiplication, square root etc)
#d Track the output of our calculation as well, so the event records the full details of what happened
